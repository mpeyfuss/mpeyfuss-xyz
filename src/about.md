**Put more simply...**

I find myself locked in at the intersection of art and technology. I love working with creators that have a vision but don't know how to bring it to life.

That's where I think I'm my strongest. I can riff with creators, helping them build something beyond their wildest imagination.

I'm not a particularly visual creator, which is why my website is minimal. But I can create magic with code, specifically around art, whether that's onchain with smart contracts or off-chain with websites, backend systems, and creative code that brings art to life.

## Past Life
I started off my career in mechanical engineering, with a focus on vehicle control systems. I spent a lot of time in college tearing cars apart and rebuilding a Camaro to be a hybrid vehicle.

After college, I went to work at Honda R&D for a few years testing engine systems at high altitude. Learned a lot, but ultimately, I ended up moving on when an opportunity opened up where my friend Ben worked.

I then spent a year testing satellite components that went to space, included some parts that went on the Orion space capsules, to be used by real astronauts. Pretty cool in retrospect.

So how did I end up in art? That's a good question.

Ben is a fanstic photographer and convinced me to look at smart contracts on Ethereum because he was convinced that there was more to be explored there. He was right.

We started building smart contracts and code that extended his photography into living artwork that would change with time or with user interaction.

People took note, started hiring us to help them do cool things with art on the blockchain, and that's how Transient Labs was born. Just from two kids messing around with some art.

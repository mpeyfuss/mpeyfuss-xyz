# About Me

I'd like to call myself a technologist, but I fear that may be giving myself too much credit. At the very least, I'm a very curious, savvy, and smart engineer.

I find myself locked in at the intersection of art and technology. I love working with creators that have a vision but don't know how to bring it to life.

That's where I can show off my superpower. I'm able to riff with creators, helping them build something beyond their wildest imagination.

In particular, I find myself having the most fun building with the blockchain and web experiences around that.

## Past Life
I started off my career in mechanical engineering, with a focus on vehicle control systems. I spent a lot of time in college tearing cars apart and rebuilding a Camaro to be a hybrid vehicle.

After college, I went to work at Honda R&D for a few years testing engine systems at high altitude. Learned a lot, but ultimately, I ended up moving on when an opportunity opened up where my friend Ben worked.

I then spent a year testing satellite components that went to space, included some parts that went on the Orion space capsules, to be used by real astronauts. Pretty cool in retrospect.

So how did I end up in art? That's a good question.

Ben is a fanstic photographer and convinced me to look at smart contracts on Ethereum because he was convinced that there was more to be explored there. He was right.

We started building smart contracts and code that extended his photography into living artwork that would change with time or with user interaction.

People took note, started hiring us to help them do cool things with art on the blockchain, and that's how Transient Labs was born. Just from two kids messing around with some art.

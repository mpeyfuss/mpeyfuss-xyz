# Moments of the Unknown: June 21st - 8:05

I’m really happy I snagged this piece from [Moments of the Unknown](https://momentsoftheunknown.com) by [Justin Aversano](https://x.com/justinaversano).

There’s a lot in this piece that resonates with me, but if I had to distill it down, the word that keeps coming up is “home.”

I grew up just five minutes from Red Rocks. It’s more than a concert venue to me. It’s the backdrop of my childhood, it's where I come from.

Yes, I saw some incredible shows there. But that’s not what lingers.

What I remember most are the quieter moments: biking or hiking through the park when I needed space, watching fireworks light up the sky with friends, or sneaking out to catch the sunrise from the amphitheater steps.

We weren’t trying to be profound. We were just kids, leaping up those giant steps like John G does in the video - laughing, chasing each other, making memories without realizing it.

That’s what this piece captures for me. A sense of wonder. A sense of place. A reminder of where I come from.

Thank you, Justin, for this incredible work and project. Can’t wait to collect more Moments. ❤️
